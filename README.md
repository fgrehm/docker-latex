# docker-latex

Docker image for building LaTeX documents (more specifically, [SBC articles](http://www.sbc.org.br/index.php?option=com_jdownloads&Itemid=195&task=view.download&cid=38))


## TODO

- Figure out how to embed the template within the container so that articles don't need to copy them over (might make sense to rename the github / docker repository to include the `sbc-article-latex` suffix to make it clear)
- Include an example of how to use and document it
